# Learning to walk with Imitation Learning

This is my solution to Homework 1 of the course. There is three main parts to my code:
- model.py: for network architecture and loss function
- trainer.py: for training each epoch/step, saving model and initializing variables
- data_generator.py: reads a pickled file generated by the expert of observations and actions, and creates a tf.Dataset


To run the expert try: 
```
python run_expert.py experts/Humanoid-v1.pkl Humanoid-v1 --render \
            --num_rollouts 20
```

To train my model:
```
python main.py -c config.json
```

To test my model and render results (need to train model first):
```
python run_model.py -c config.json
```
